# Towers

A tile building cooperative board game.

## TODO

- Ability to move a character
  - I don't like the world data structure that makes us repeat x y z in data and shape
    (maybe just a single flat list of tiles would be better)
  - Neighbors
  - Some kind of command-patternish thing to modify the hero pos
- Tile-placing cards
- Simple goals

...

- Second player (I think the board should always be angled POV to the character)


## Building and Running

I'm using the boot template from here: https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-cljs-example.

To get going:
> boot dev
(visit http://localhost:3000/)

To repl:
> boot repl --client
> boot.user=> (start-repl)
(reload the page)


## Overview

Here's the unbaked idea:

We have a small tile-based world (5 x 5 x ?) and two players. Players have a deck
of cards and a hand (5 cards). Some cards are actions (place a tile of a certain
type, jump, swap positions) and some cards are goals (eg. line up tiles in a certain
pattern). A player can also choose to move their character one tile on the board.

Players take turns. During their turn they can perform 3 moves-- either moving the
character or playing an action card.

Players score by achieving a goal in their hand.

Scores are *shared* amongst players, but hands (and therefore goals) are secret.


## Action Cards

- place various block types
- jump
- power jump


## Goal Cards
